pdl-steam (0.75) README

pdl-steam will install, update, and run an hlstatsx site and multiple hlds and
srcds based game servers along with their associated plugin managers. It reads
settings and server definitions from 'pdl-steam.conf' that consist of the
following attributes:

[NAME]
  used as the screen id and prefix for some files (required)
[SERV]
  server type; either hlds or srcds (required)
[PORT]
  network port; typically 27015 or above (required)
[GAME]
  server-specific game/mod to use (required)
  hlds: cstrike|dod|tfc|valve
  srcds: cstrike|dod|dystopia|hl2mp|insurgency|left4dead|left4dead2|tf|zps
[CFGS]
  space-separated list of any cfg files to use
  if prefixed with "+", the cfg runs once on startup
  if prefixed with "@", the cfg runs after the map loads
  if prefixed with "%", the cfg runs after the map and plugin manager load
[OPTS]
  miscellaneous options and commands to include on the startup line
[PLGS]
  space-separated list of plugins to use (without file extensions)
  the appropriate hlstatsx plugin will be automatically included
[MOTD]
  url to redirect users to; if unspecified, the mapcycle will be shown
[DBUG]
  if "yes", server logging and debug support will be enabled

Example:

NAME[0]="cssdm"
SERV[0]="srcds"
PORT[0]="27015"
GAME[0]="cstrike"
CFGS[0]="+cssdm @cssdm-onmap %cssdm-plugins cssdm-tourney-mode"
OPTS[0]="-nohltv"
PLGS[0]="ratechecker"
MOTD[0]="http://myfastdlserver.com/cssdm-motd.html"
DBUG[0]="no"

One hlstatsx instance (which is the perl daemon running on localhost with access
to a database) is run for all game servers. It responds to the following
variables:

[DB_HOST]
  network host for the database server (default: localhost)
[DB_NAME]
  name of the database (default: hlstatsx)
[DB_USER]
  username for the database (default: hlstatsx)
[DB_PASS]
  password for the database (default: hlstatsx)

A number of installation and upgrade operations for hlstatsx will need to be
performed manually, and so the user is prompted. In addition, a backup of the
database and an update of geoip data will be performed weekly, or before an
hlstatsx upgrade.

On server startup, the specified config files and plugins will be symlinked into
the game directory, so that they can be held and edited conveniently in one
place. Game content will be updated, and each server starts inside of a screen
session.

Place configuration files in a directory named 'configs'. An 'autoexec.cfg' and
a 'bans.cfg' file will be used for settings and bans that apply to all servers.
A '$NAME_mapcycle.txt' file will be used as the mapcycle for the server, with
the first map listed to be added to the startup line "+map" parameter. For users
who have disabled in-game HTML, a '$NAME_motd_text.txt' is used as a fallback
for some scrds games. The '$NAME_admins.ini' file is used as the admin/user
definitions file, which is either 'users.ini' or 'admins_simple.ini' for amxmodx
or sourcemod respectively. A file named '$NAME_commands.ini' will be used as the
command definitions/overrides file, which is either 'cmds.ini' for amxmodx, or
'admin-overrides.cfg' for sourcemod. Finally, '$NAME_database.cfg' will be used
as the database definition file for the plugin manager, either 'sql.cfg' for
amxmodx, or 'databases.cfg' for sourcemod. Required or specified files that are
not present in 'configs' at run-time will be filled with the defaults or will be
created blank.

Place plugin files in a directory named 'plugins'. If a sourcemod plugin has a
translation file (*.phrases.txt'), also place it in the 'plugins' directory.
If the target is a directory, the directory structure and all contents will be
symlinked at the game directory.

Server definitions with a port or game already specified for another server will
be skipped. Configuration files and hlstatsx backups are kept protected from
other users on the system with file permissions.
